Ingredients:

    1[1/2] cups dried chickpeas
    1[1/2] cups dried fava beans
    6 cups water
    1 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
    [1/2] cup fresh parsley, chopped
    1 roughly chopped large yellow onion
    6 cloves garlic
    3 tsp. salt
    2 TB. ground coriander seeds
    1 TB. ground cumin
    1 tsp. ground black pepper
    [1/2] tsp. cayenne
    [1/4] cup plain breadcrumbs
    3 TB. all-purpose flour
    1 TB. baking soda
    1 TB. baking powder
    8 cups vegetable oil
    4 (6-in.) pitas
    2 large sliced tomatoes
    Pickled Turnips
    2 cups shredded lettuce
    Tahini Sauce


?Directions:

In a large bowl, combine chickpeas and fava beans with water. Set aside to soak overnight or for 8 or 9 hours.

Drain beans, and add them to a food processor fitted with a chopping blade. Blend for 2 minutes, intermittently 
stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Transfer bean mixture back to the large bowl.

In the food processor, blend cilantro, parsley, yellow onion, garlic, salt, coriander, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne 
for 1 minute or until smooth. Transfer mixture to the large bowl.

Add breadcrumbs, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and baking powder to the bowl, and mix well. Set aside for 15 minutes.

In a large pot over medium heat, heat vegetable oil to 365ºF. Using an ice-cream scoop or 2 spoons, form falafel mixture 
into golf ball–size patties. Carefully drop falafel balls in oil, and fry for about 4 minutes or until dark golden brown. 
Do not overcrowd the pot.

Remove falafel from oil, and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.

To assemble, cut pitas in half and open the pockets. Place 3 falafel balls in the pocket, and add some tomatoes, 
Pickled Turnips (Kabees), and lettuce. Drizzle with Tahini Sauce (Tarator), and serve.
